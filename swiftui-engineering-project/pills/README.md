# Pills

You have most likely used pills extensively at Makers.

However, we think it's worth reminding about these every now and then.

## How to use the pills in this module

Pills are great to isolate blocks of learning.

We recommend you use the pills in this directory as you encounter new concepts
throughout the week, e.g. at some point you may need to add Environment
Variables in Xcode, and you may not know how. That would be a good time to check
whether there is a pill for that (there is one indeed!).

Feel free to use the feedback links for the project to suggest new pills to be
added! This is a dynamic repository and will be updated over time. Your
contributions are key :star:
