# Cloudinary

Cloudinary is a cloud-based service that allows you to upload, store, manage,
and deliver images and videos.

It offers a wide range of features like transformations, optimizations, and much
more. However, for this week, we'll focus on its basic functionalities:
uploading and retrieving images.

More precisely, in the context of this week's learning, you'll be using
Cloudinary to handle image uploads during the sign-up process and for creating
new posts.

You'll also use it to fetch and display images in the posts feed.

## Why Cloudinary?

There are several reasons, but some are:
- Ease of use
- Integrates well with iOS apps
- Scalability and performance

## Getting Started

To get started with Cloudinary, you'll need to create an account and obtain your
API credentials. These credentials include:

- Cloud Name: Identifies your cloud storage.
- API Key: Used for authentication.
- API Secret: Also used for authentication (keep this secret!).

:warning: Store these credentials securely and never commit them directly in
your codebase. Use environment variables or a secure method to store them.
